Single page app to scrape and save lunch menues from webpages

## What it can do
Tired of checking your favorite restaurant's webpage every monday to see their weekly menue? The single page app "LunchLovers" makes it possible to save and update content from a webpage. 

## How it works
- The user needs to copy and paste the exact webpage address into the app
- The whole content (excluding scripts, links and images) gets loaded
- The user can pick and save the content he or she is interested in
- After saving the content, it can be viewed in the menue section
- The saved menues can be updated from within the app â€“ without going to the particular webpage or re-selecting the content
